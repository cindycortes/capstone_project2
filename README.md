# Project Description

##### Dispatch: 

Dispatch is an invoice management tool built to help independent truck drivers more effectively manage contracts by digitizing and organizing their invoices. This was a capstone final project that was built in two full weeks and presented publicly. 

### Why Dispatch?
Independent truck drivers still manually use log books to track mileage, time worked, etc along with creating traces of paperwork just to be assigned a job. The manual hand-written invoice creation process is time consuming and drivers can't be paid until an invoice is sent. 

This app will help with keep track of invoices, create up more free time for drivers to find a new gig, and especially uselful when it comes to tax season.
